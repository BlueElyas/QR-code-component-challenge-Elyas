## Overview

### Screenshot

I have been learning HTML, CSS and JS for the past 2 weeks using the Scrimba front end developer path. I decided to start the front-end mentor challenges to start putting my skills into practice and getting comfortable with different techniques.
This was my first challenge and a simple QR design

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**


## My process

I used HTML and CSS in order to build it. I was getting used to using comments, classes and DRYer code.
I decided to add a hover effect and change up the anchor tags to make them stylish. I wanted to also add some CSS like "user-select:none;" to get used to considering user accessibility.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

I will continue my development by doing 2-3 front-end mentor challenges a week and focusing on the Scrimba course I am doing. I want to increase the difficulty each time with the FrontEnd Mentor challenges and also start doing projects that require javascript.

I will also facilitate my learning with more reading around the content I am learning.

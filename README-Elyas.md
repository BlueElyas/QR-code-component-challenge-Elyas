## Overview

### Screenshot

I have been learning HTML, CSS and JS for the past 2 weeks using the Scrimba front end developer path. I decided to start the front-end mentor challenges to start putting my skills into practice and getting comfortable with different techniques.
This was my first challenge and a simple QR design

## My process

I used HTML and CSS in order to build it. I was getting used to using comments, classes and DRYer code.
I decided to add a hover effect and change up the anchor tags to make them stylish. I wanted to also add some CSS like "user-select:none;" to get used to considering user accessibility.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

I will continue my development by doing 2-3 front-end mentor challenges a week and focusing on the Scrimba course I am doing. I want to increase the difficulty each time with the FrontEnd Mentor challenges and also start doing projects that require javascript.

I will also facilitate my learning with more reading around the content I am learning.
